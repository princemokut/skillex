## Questions for You

1. **Priority**: Should we start with M0 (scaffolding) or do you want to see a specific milestone first?

2. **Matching Algorithm**: The API has a placeholder for `/v1/match/preview`. Do you want me to implement a basic matching algorithm, or should I focus on the frontend first?

3. **Design System**: Do you have any specific design preferences, or should I use a clean, modern approach with shadcn/ui?

4. **Testing**: How important is testing for the MVP? Should I include basic tests in M7 or focus on functionality first?

5. **Timeline**: What's your preferred timeline? I estimate 25-35 hours total across all milestones.

Would you like me to proceed with M0 (scaffolding) or would you prefer to discuss any of these milestones in more detail first?

My answers (to Cursor)

Priority
Start with M0 (scaffolding) in /apps/web (monorepo). After M0, implement other milestones 

Matching Algorithm
Focus frontend first. Consume POST /v1/match/preview. If the endpoint returns placeholder data, that‚Äôs fine for now. No frontend mocks unless the API is unreachable‚Äîif so, use MSW with a small fixture and remove it once the real endpoint is ready.

Design System
Use shadcn/ui + Tailwind with a professional, professional network/jobsites-adjacent look:
Typography: Inter/system, base text-[15px], titles text-lg/2xl.
Color tokens (Tailwind):
primary: blue-600/blue-700
accent: blue-100/blue-50
neutrals: slate-900/700/500/300/200/100
borders: slate-200
Density: default compact list views; comfy on detail pages.
Radii & shadows: rounded-lg/rounded-2xl, shadow-sm/md.
Components to generate (shadcn): Button, Input, Card, Tabs, Dialog, DropdownMenu, Badge, Avatar, Toast.
Layout: top nav + left rail + main + right rail (AdSlot). Accessible focus states everywhere.

Testing
Ship functionality first. Include light tests at M8:
Unit: HeatmapPicker, MatchCard
‚ÄúHappy path‚Äù smoke (Playwright/Cypress) for onboarding ‚Üí matches
Basic API client tests with mocked fetch

Timeline
Your timeline estimate is fine. let's just do the work one by one
